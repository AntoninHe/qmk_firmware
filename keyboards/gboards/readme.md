# gBoards Dicts/Combos

Ever wanted to do some crazy stuff with combos or onboard steno? Here's a big repo for you to include into your 
keymaps. You may need to do some configuration on your part, for the documentation hit up [docs.gboards.ca](http://docs.gboards.ca/)

## Combos
This is a set of dicts that templates macros ontop of QMK. Use this for augmenting your current setup with 
multi-chords! You can browse the avalible combo lists in combos/


## Engine
This is the onboard chording engine for all sorts of fun shenanigans. Be aware that this currently is a bit of a QMK 
replacement focused on pure chording. Take a look at the configuration in keyboards/ginny for ideas, all these dicts
are stored over in dicts/
